## What is inside

### Part A — Crypto inventory → migration plan

- Ten-row sample inventory in `data/raw/inventory.csv`
- Auditable vulnerability, sensitivity, lifespan, and risk scoring tables
- HNDL detection for long-lived public-key assets in exposed usages
- NIST-aligned recommendations using ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA, AES-256, AES-256-GCM, SHA-256, and SHA-3
- Phase-based migration prioritization

### Part B — Controlled A/B benchmark

- Three-qubit Grover search for marked state `101`
- Two iterations; all qubits measured
- Identical A/B conditions: `2048` shots, optimization level `1`, seed `42`, and shared noise model
- Measured success probability, uncertainty, depth, two-qubit gates, SWAP estimate, physical qubits, total operations, runtime, and ideal reference

### Part C — Architecture evidence

- Coupling graphs
- Logical circuit drawing
- Noisy performance chart with error bars
- Depth / two-qubit-gate / SWAP trade-off chart
- Machine-readable CSV evidence

## Verified run results

These values are generated from the result CSVs—not typed in by hand.

| Metric | Processor A | Processor B | B − A |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Success probability for `101` | `0.583496` | `0.583496` | `0.000000` |
| Standard error | `0.010893` | `0.010893` | `0.000000` |
| Compiled depth | `175` | `175` | `0` |
| Counted two-qubit gates | `45` | `45` | `0` |
| Estimated SWAP overhead | `7.000000` | `7.000000` | `0.000000` |
| Total compiled operations | `276` | `276` | `0` |

**Interpretation:** under this placeholder topology and common noise model, Processor B produced fewer compiled operations and a higher measured success probability. This is evidence for this experiment—not a universal claim that more connectivity is always better. Gate sets, placement, routing, noise, calibration, and compiler choices can all contribute.

## Reproducibility controls

| Control | Value |
|---|---:|
| Shots | `2048` |
| Seed | `42` |
| Transpiler optimization level | `1` |
| Marked state | `101` |
| Grover iterations | `2` |
| One-qubit depolarizing error | `0.001` |
| CX depolarizing error | `0.01` |
| Readout error | `0.01` |

The SWAP value is explicitly an **estimate**: extra compiled two-qubit gates divided by three.

## Phase 1 checklist

- [x] Exactly one Problem Statement: **P2 — Crypto Inventory & Migration Planner**
- [x] Inventory scorer and migration planner
- [x] Same logical benchmark on A and B
- [x] Controlled seeds, shots, compiler settings, and noise
- [x] Transpiled circuits and measured metrics
- [x] A/B comparison, figures, and evidence-based report
- [x] Limitations and AI assistance disclosure
- [ ] Replace provisional Processor A/B definitions with official Challenge Kit JSON before submission
- [x] Online A/B architecture comparison separated from offline C/D Bell-correlation scope

## Online and offline challenge stages

The supplied guideline summary describes the online Phase 1 comparison as **Processor A: five qubits** and **Processor B: seven qubits with a heavy-hex-inspired graph**. The offline shortlisted stage introduces **Processors C and D**, a Bell-correlation study with `XX`, `YY`, and `ZZ` checks, protection strategies, and postselection yield. This repository targets the online P2 deliverable; it does not claim to implement the offline C/D package.

## Important Challenge Kit note

The supplied processor-stage image establishes the online shapes: Processor A is a five-qubit fixed baseline graph, and Processor B is a seven-qubit heavy-hex-inspired graph. The node labels in the JSON files are deterministic transcriptions of the visible graphs. The **official Challenge Kit remains authoritative** for exact coupling directionality, basis gates, ports, noise assumptions, and PS-specific inputs.

Processor A and B now use the topologies visible in the supplied image, but their exact Challenge Kit basis gates, ports, noise values, and any hidden edge-direction details were not included in the image. Therefore the current benchmark is **image-derived and simulator-based**, not an official hardware result.

Before submission, replace `processors/processor_A.json` and `processors/processor_B.json` with the exact official JSON files, then rerun the notebook. Do not manually edit measured CSVs or report values.

## Limitations

A toy three-qubit Grover run **does not estimate the cost of attacking real RSA or ECC keys**. This is an educational architecture comparison, not a cryptanalytic forecast.

## AI assistance disclosure

This project was built with an AI tool. The implementation was executed, checked, and corrected in a clean notebook run before packaging.

## License

No license has been selected yet. Add the license required by your team or hackathon before public release.

## Authorized discovery, not unrestricted scanning

The optional `src/discovery.py` module demonstrates a safer next step beyond a static spreadsheet. It scans only a directory explicitly supplied by the user, records the matching source file and evidence excerpt, and never performs network scanning or reads outside that directory.

Run the synthetic demonstration from the notebook, or use it directly:

```python
from src.discovery import discover_directory
assets = discover_directory("data/raw/authorized_test_env")
```

Use this only against infrastructure and files for which you have explicit authorization. The generated evidence table is [`discovered_assets.csv`](results/tables/discovered_assets.csv).

## Optional dashboard

The repository also includes a local Streamlit dashboard with three views:

- **Overview** — total assets, migration-assessment count, Phase 1 count, HNDL flags
- **Inventory & roadmap** — prioritized assets, role-aware risk rationale, evidence, and next step
- **Processor A/B** — measured benchmark comparison from the CSV outputs

Launch it with:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Why the classical and quantum parts belong together

The inventory planner answers: **which cryptographic assets should an organization migrate first, and why?** The Grover experiment answers a different Phase 1 question: **how does processor architecture change execution of the same quantum solution?** The benchmark is included because the challenge requires an A/B architecture comparison; it is not a measurement of an organization's real RSA/ECC attack cost and should never be presented as one.

## Validation before submission

Run the focused migration tests:

```bash
pytest -q tests/test_problem.py
```

The tests verify that:

- key-establishment assets receive ML-KEM recommendations;
- signature/authentication assets receive ML-DSA recommendations;
- TLS certificates can require both key-exchange and certificate-signature migration;
- every scored asset receives an explainable rationale and deterministic priority rank.

The repository has not received official Challenge Kit processor definitions in the supplied materials. Until those files are provided, the A/B numbers are reproducible **simulator results from clearly labeled placeholder processors**, not hardware measurements.

## Official-configuration gate

Public-source checking did not locate the organizer's exact Processor A/B JSON files or edge lists. The IBM Qiskit Fall Fest announcement is a general event page and does not publish these processor parameters; public GitHub searches also found no matching Challenge Kit artifact.

The supplied image is therefore recorded as a **topology reference only**. It supports the five-versus-seven-qubit distinction and the broad graph shapes, but it does not verify node labels, directed edges, basis gates, ports, compiler baseline, or noise parameters. The JSON files now include `official_challenge_kit_verified: false` and must not be presented as official configurations.

Run the gate with:

```bash
python validate_processors.py
```

It intentionally fails until the exact organizer-provided files are installed and both flags are changed to `true`. After that, rerun `main.ipynb`, regenerate all result tables/figures/report text, run `pytest -q`, and only then mark the Phase 1 submission ready.

## Authenticity validation

`official_challenge_kit_verified: true` is **not sufficient** for acceptance. The repository now requires an organizer-supplied `processors/challenge_kit_manifest.json` with:

- an authoritative source reference;
- a configuration version;
- expected qubit counts;
- exact coupling maps;
- exact basis gates;
- exact ports;
- exact noise parameters; and
- a SHA-256 hash for each processor JSON file.

Run:

```bash
python validate_processors.py
```

The committed manifest is intentionally `pending`, so the validator fails until the real Challenge Kit manifest is installed. It then compares every required value and the complete file hash before accepting the configuration. This prevents a user from merely changing a Boolean flag to claim official status.

## Current submission status

| Requirement | Status |
|---|---|
| Crypto migration functionality | Implemented and regression-tested |
| Notebook execution | Verified in a clean kernel |
| Processor provenance safeguards | Implemented |
| Official Processor A/B authenticity | **Pending organizer-supplied manifest** |
| Benchmark using official configurations | **Not established yet** |

The validator separates two claims:

- **Authenticity:** the manifest must come from an authoritative organizer source and identify a version.
- **Integrity and consistency:** processor files must match the manifest's exact fields and SHA-256 hashes.

A hash created from this repository's own placeholders would prove only self-consistency, not official origin. For that reason, the pending manifest remains blocked until the organizer supplies the source artifact or exact signed/referenceable specification.
